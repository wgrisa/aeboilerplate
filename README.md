# AEboilerplate LITE

This fork contains a lighter version of the [AEBoilerplate](https://github.com/agencyenterprise/aeboilerplate) .

A full-stack React/Node/Typescript web project starter that focuses primarily on ease-of-use and simplicity.

AEboilerplate is an _opinionated_ boilerplate that includes independent client and API applications packaged into one repository. It is ready to be run and deployed out-of-the-box and comes preconfigured with state management, continuous integration, testing, code-formatting, and much more.

## Motivation

At [AE Studio](https://ae.studio/), we are constantly working on new projects and find ourselves spending time setting up applications that could be better used to build out features. To improve our process, we decided to take our favorite technologies and bundle them into a boilerplate to help kickstart our projects faster.
